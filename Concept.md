# Caller ID Spoofing and P1 Bots: Conceptual Overview

## What is Caller ID Spoofing?

Caller ID spoofing is the practice of manipulating the caller identification information transmitted during a phone call. Attackers use this to impersonate trusted entities, conceal their identity, or bypass call-blocking measures.

In VoIP systems, spoofing is often enabled through SIP trunks, which route calls over the internet and allow flexible caller ID customization.

## Understanding P1 Bots

"P1 bots" refer to automated dialing systems used by fraudsters to place high volumes of spoofed calls, often for scams such as phishing, robocalling, coinbase calling, and social engineering attacks.

These bots integrate with SIP trunks to:

- Generate spoofed caller IDs  
- Automate dialing sequences  
- Bypass detection through caller ID rotation  
- Scale scam campaigns globally  

## Why Study These Tools?

The widespread abuse of VoIP and SIP infrastructure by scammers poses significant risks to telecom operators and end users. By dissecting these tools and techniques, researchers can develop better detection mechanisms and disruption strategies.
