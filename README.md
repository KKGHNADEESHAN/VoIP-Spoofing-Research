Welcome to the **VoIP Spoofing Research** repository! This project delves into the techniques used for VoIP caller ID spoofing and the development of automated scam call bots, often referred to as "P1 bots." Our goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of these methods, their implications, and the tools that can be used to study them.

## Introduction

VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) has revolutionized communication. However, with its rise, new challenges have emerged, particularly in security. Caller ID spoofing is one such issue, allowing malicious actors to disguise their identity during calls. This repository aims to explore these techniques in depth.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on two main areas:

1. **Caller ID Spoofing Techniques**: We investigate various methods used to alter caller ID information, enabling the analysis of their effectiveness and potential countermeasures.

2. **Automated Scam Call Bots (P1 Bots)**: We develop and document the creation of automated systems that can place calls using spoofed IDs. This section serves as both a technical guide and a cautionary tale about the misuse of technology.

## Technologies Used

This project employs a variety of technologies and tools, including:

- **SIP Trunks**: For managing VoIP calls.
- **Telegram Bot API**: For integrating messaging features.
- **SMS APIs**: To facilitate communication.
- **Python**: The primary programming language for developing scripts and tools.
- **Docker**: For containerizing applications.

## Installation

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KKGHNADEESHAN/VoIP-Spoofing-Research.git
   cd VoIP-Spoofing-Research
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed, then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your configuration details.

4. **Run the Application**:
   Start the application using:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can explore the following features:

- **Spoof Caller ID**: Input a number to spoof and select the desired caller ID.
- **P1 Bot Configuration**: Set up parameters for the automated calling system.
- **Monitor Activity**: Track calls made and received through the application.
