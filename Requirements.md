# Requirements for VoIP Spoofing and P1 Bot Setup

## Core Components

- **PBX Software**: Asterisk or FreePBX installed on a VPS or local machine to handle call routing  
- **SIP Trunk Provider**: we used a no KYC SIP provider at [voizhen.com](https://voizhen.com)  
- **Softphone or SIP Client**: To initiate and test calls with spoofed caller IDs  
- **Automation Scripts**: Custom tools or scripts to automate call generation (details in Tools.md)  

## Network and Hosting

- Reliable internet connection with proper firewall and port forwarding  
- VPS or dedicated server to run PBX software and automation tools  
- Domain and TLS certificates for secure SIP signaling (optional but recommended)  

## User Accounts and Authentication
